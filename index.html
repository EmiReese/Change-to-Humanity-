          <h3>Food for Food</h3>
          <p>Food for Food has been an amazing acomplishment for our organization.
          Whole Foods and Amazon donate food every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.
          This allows us to bring food to the food insecure refugees in Clarkston 
          and to the communities in Chamblee Tucker; as well as to the Boyde L. Ansley School,
          a school for children who's parents experience and have experienced homelessness.
          We are grateful too be able to serve in total up to 240 food insecure families every week.

          <h3>Community Garden</h3>
          <p>Building personal gardens and a community garden at
             Joseph E. Lowery Blvd with the community will not only 
             be a solution to the food desert and food insecurity problem 
             in the community of Bankhead, but it will also help in
              building relationships and access to healthy nutrition.</p>
