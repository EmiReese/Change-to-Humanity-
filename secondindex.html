                <h3 class="subtitle">The Founder</h3>
    
                <p>Giselle was born in Germany and brought up for most of </p>
                <p>her early years in an orphanage. At 10, she was placed with foster </p>
                <p>parents who were farmers in a small village in Southern Germany. </p>
                <p>At the age of 18, she began her 3-year studies and graduated </p>
                <p>as a nurse and was employed in Stuttgart and Frankfurt until 1975.</p> 
                    
                <p>In August of 1975, Giselle could not refuse the opportunity</p>
                <p>to join and follow her husband when he was invited to lead a </p>
                <p>two year medical research program at the University of </p>
                <p>Southern California (USC). Those two years extended into a </p>
                <p>lifetime stay that was welcomed and loved by Giselle. </p>
                <p>It not only gave her the opportunity to learn a second language and </p>
                <p>experience another culture, it also allowed her to follow a dream</p> 
                <p>she had as a little girl.</p> 
                    
                   <p>This dream–to one day make a difference in the life</p>
                   <p>of the many feeling lost, neglected and rejected–would </p>
                   <p>become reality in later years and prompted her to say: </p>
                   <p>“I am privileged to have lived life from one spectrum to the other</p>
                   <p>in every shade of color. That allowed me to understand people </p>
                   <p>and life in all sorts of situations in a very profound way. </p>
                   <p>It caused me to develop humility, compassion, love and</p>
                   <p>non- judgment. Without that privilege, I would have never gotten</p>
                   <p>to know that; but most of all, I would have missed out on knowing</p>
                   <p>who I truly am. That experience is what I see as true </p>
                   <p>wealth–a wealth I decided to share with others. </p>
                   <p>I am inspired to serve as God’s tool and am deeply grateful</p>
                   <p>to be supported by like minded, experienced people serving</p>
                   <p>Change to Humanity as directors of the board, staff, </p>
                   <p>volunteers, partners, donors and community.”</p>
                    
                   <p>Giselle has three daughters and four grandchildren. </p>
                   <p>She is divorced and lives in Atlanta, GA while fulfilling</p>
                   <p>her mission through Change to Humanity.</p>
