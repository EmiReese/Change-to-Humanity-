                    “I am privileged to have lived life from one spectrum to the other
                    in every shade of color. That allowed me to understand people 
                    and life in all sorts of situations in a very profound way. 
                    It caused me to develop humility, compassion, love and
                    non- judgment. Without that privilege, I would have never gotten
                    to know that; but most of all, I would have missed out on knowing
                    who I truly am. That experience is what I see as true 
                    wealth–a wealth I decided to share with others. 
                    I am inspired to serve as God’s tool and am deeply grateful
                    to be supported by like minded, experienced people serving
                    Change to Humanity as directors of the board, staff, 
                    volunteers, partners, donors and community.”
