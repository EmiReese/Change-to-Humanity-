                <p>“I am privileged to have lived life from one spectrum to the other</p>
                <p>in every shade of color. That allowed me to understand people </p>
                <p>and life in all sorts of situations in a very profound way. </p>
                <p>It caused me to develop humility, compassion, love and</p>
                <p>non- judgment. Without that privilege, I would have never gotten</p>
                <p>to know that; but most of all, I would have missed out on knowing</p>
                <p>who I truly am. That experience is what I see as true </p>
                <p>wealth–a wealth I decided to share with others. </p>
                <p>I am inspired to serve as God’s tool and am deeply grateful</p>
                <p>to be supported by like minded, experienced people serving</p>
                <p>Change to Humanity as directors of the board, staff, </p>
                <p>volunteers, partners, donors and community.”</p>
