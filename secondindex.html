            <h3>The Founder</h3>
            <p>
                Giselle was born in Germany and brought up for most of her early years in an orphanage. At 10, she was placed with foster 
                parents who were farmers in a small village in Southern Germany. 
                At the age of 18, she began her 3-year studies and graduated as a nurse and was employed in Stuttgart and Frankfurt until 1975.
                
                In August of 1975, Giselle could not refuse the opportunity to join 
                and follow her husband when he was invited to lead a two year medical 
                research program at the University of Southern California (USC). Those two years 
                extended into a lifetime stay that was welcomed and loved by Giselle. It not only gave her the opportunity to learn a second language and 
                experience another culture, it also allowed her to follow a dream she had as a little girl.
                
                This dream–to one day make a difference in the life of the many feeling 
                lost, neglected and rejected–would become reality in later years and prompted 
                her to say: “I am privileged to have lived life from one spectrum to the other in every 
                shade of color. That allowed me to understand people and life in all sorts of situations in a very profound way. 
                It caused me to develop humility, compassion, love and non- judgment. Without that privilege, 
                I would have never gotten to know that; but most of all, I would have missed out on knowing who I truly am. 
                That experience is what I see as true wealth–a wealth I decided to share with others. 
                I am inspired to serve as God’s tool and am deeply grateful to be supported by like minded, 
                experienced people serving Change to Humanity as directors of the board, staff, volunteers, partners, donors and community.”
                
                Giselle has three daughters and four grandchildren. 
                She is divorced and lives in Atlanta, GA while fulfilling her mission through Change to Humanity.

                     and to provide an outlet and support for at risk-youth. Grace is pleased to be a part of Change to Humanity. This opportunity provides her with another avenue to take part in making a difference for the betterment of tomorrow.
